        // == abstract equality
        // === strict equality

        console.log(3 == "3"); //string 3 converted to number 3 before comparison is made, so returns true
        console.log(3 === "3"); //but its strictly not the same. one is a string one is a number, so returns false


        console.log(true == "1"); //in JS true = to 1, but false = to 0. So this returns true
        console.log(true === "1"); //but its strictly not true, so returns false


        console.log("This is a string" == new String("This is a string")); //string literals (1st string) are different than string objects (2nd string)
        console.log("This is a string" === new String("This is a string")); //but again this is STRICTLY not true.

        // SO IN SUMMARY ITS USUALLY BETTER TOU USE === TO MAKE STRICT COMPARISONS SO YOUR CODE DOES NOT ACCDENTALY CAUSE FALSE COMPARISONS,
        // CAUSE BY ABSTRACT EQUALITY. (lol, confusing but i get it.)
