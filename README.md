# JavaScript_Projects

In this repo i will be uploading some JavaScript based projects that are made from either, following tutorials && / || from courses covering the basics of JS. 

In the folder JS_Basic_Course, the files are all html but with inline script tags. Its done for the reason that im just working with the console and are displaying everything with console.log in the course so i did not create individual script files for simplicity reasons.
